# Drone-Application
this repository contains the all the details required for the drone making from failed protypes to successful runs.<br>
**Title and Team Information**:<br>
Title: Delivery Drone Simulator<br>
<br>**Team Members**:<br>
Manal Faisal: Programmer 1<br>
Fatima Faizan: Programmer 2<br>
Minahil Tahir: Logic designer/Git manager/Tester<br>
<br>**Overview/Programme Description**:<br>
This programme backs up the idea for the future where <ins>human delivered parcels</ins> will be <ins>replaced</ins> by machines.
It gives us a direction of how drone delivery service's code might look like and how the code will handle the obstacles that a drone will face during the delivery of the package.We are trying to keep it as user-friendly as possible as it is just a prototype for a real-life drone delivery service.Not only that but we have also included a unique <ins>Coupon System</ins> in our code that will provide the user a discount on his/her next order if the delivery was not satisfactory.The coupon will always be randomly generated.This feature was added to form a bond of trust and empathy with our users.<br>
<br>**Programme/Logic Design**:<br>
Functions Implemented:<br>
1. Muliple if statements used for conditions for example weather conditions,time,battery life etc.<br>
2. bool weather(),bool day() and bool time() has been used.<br>
   -Bool weather(): 3 random weathers are initiated in it like sunny.windy.rainy using modulus.<br>
   -Bool day(): declare time= current_time().It will catch the exact time of the device used.Very useful as time is never the     same twice.<br>
3. 






<br>**Execution Instructions**:<br>
The code has been designed and tested on "write name of complier" complier.<br>
>The code might fail to run on Visual Studio code complier due the complexity between these two complier.One complier might be able to debug something successfully while the other complier fails to do so.<br>

<br>**Team Collaboration**:<br>
Team lead:Manal Faisal.<br>
          This team member plays a vital role of forming the base of the drone's code. 
Fatima Faisal: refining and correcting the final code.This team member is essential for rechecking the code and adding additional features to it in order to keep it updated.<br>


<br>**Ai Tool Reflection**:<br>
Ai used: ChatGPT<br>
Reason: ChatGPT has been used by my team to double-check the code and to confirm if it does not contain any errors or not.
>ChatGPT has not been used to correct the errors, just used for <ins>pin-pointing the errors</ins>.<br>
>W3 school was used to solve error for time fucntion by using #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS<br>



No Ai was used for documentation.<br>
No Ai was used for brain-storming ideas for the drone simulator assignment.<br>


<br>**Future Improvements**:<br>
Things that can be improved by my team if we had learnt arrays or any other c++ functions are:<br>
1. Shorter code than the current code.
>Less storage used which is a good programmer practice.<br>
2. Lower case function has not been taught in c++ which could have helped in the "Begin string" in our code so that we wouldn't have to introduce the strings in both uper and lower case again and again.<br>

3. For coupon system,we preffered concatination of strings over arrays as lesser for loops were used in it.<br>
